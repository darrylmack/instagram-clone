Instagram clone built using NextJS and React. It duplicates much of the functionality of the real Instagram including Posts, Likes, Comments and Image Uploads. I use Firebase for authentication, database and file storage. It is styled using Tailwind CSS and has a responsive design so it works on mobile and desktop. The site is deployed on Vercel and pulls from Github for continuous deployment.
